            What is the difference between Javascript and other languages? 
             
            JavaScript is supposed to be for frontend tasks. Front end is what you have to
            display to the end users. Other languages are specifically for handling 
            backend server tasks. For example, Java, C++, .Net etc. etc.

             What is frontend? 
              Front End is what you display to the end users. These aren't supposed to be
             secure or sensitive information, as it can be viewable by any one using the internet.
             Example of frontend content is html, css, javascript files. Also assets or public folder
             that has been set permission to be viewable by end users.

            what are browsers, and why they behave differently?
              
               Browsers are programs or interface to surf/browse the internet. Browsers
            render content sent from Server(Secured) to client's machine or computer.
            Most of the browsers have certain level of standard as to rendering html
            content. But different browser sometimes render elements differently or tries
            enhance it. While some browser need plugin or upgrade to render content correctly.

            what is a frontend and backend?

            what is developer tool?
               Developer tool is feature in browser, which let us examine various
            part of rendered content. Such as html elements, network resources and 
            console to test out javascript variables etc.

             what is coding challenge?
            -  first Javascript variables 'var', string, number, objects, boolean and 
              console.log

              JavaScript datatypes: number, string, boolean, array, object, undefined etc.
              
              var, let, const are variable modifier. 
              var redeclares a variable. It also does something called hoisting: if a
              variable doesn't exist it declares or hoist it.
              let decleares a variable also creates a scope for the variable. we can't
              use let for same variable in the same scope anymore
              const makes a variable, object or function constant, or immutable.

            - String
             what is string in Javascript. 
               String is a data type in js to represent textual variables: such as
               words, texts etc.

            introducing strings methods 
              
              Common string methods.
               i. indexOf(str), indexOf(str, indextostart), lastIndexOf(str), 
               includes(str), split(), length
                
                substring, substr, slice, splice 
                str.replace(oldstr,newstr)
                toLowerCase(), toUpperCase()
                str.concat(str2,str3,str4...)
              
             
             changing value of string
